# Bankers-Algorithm

Banker’s Algorithm is an algorithm which specializes in resource allocation and deadlock avoidance. 
This algorithm simulates by making a predefined/predetermined maximum possible amount resources that is to be allocated. 
It then creates a what you call a “s-state” check to test for activities that may occur, this will determine if the resources are to be allowed to continue to be allocated. 

Program consist the following:
- Number of Processes
- Number of Resources
- Maximum Resources (Inputs must be separated with spaces)
- Allocated for each process (Inputs must be separated with spaces)
- Maximum for each process
- Total Allocated Resources
- Total Available Resources
- Need Resources
- Available resources
- Tells the process if it is in the safe state
- Process execution flow
